# NLP-Project - Performing Sentiment Analysis on Publicly traded stocks in the U.S using SEC's 10-k filings

SEC 10-k filings:

•A 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance and is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
•The report contains much more detail than a company's annual report, which is sent to its shareholders before an annual meeting to elect company directors.
•Some of the information a company is required to document in the 10-K includes its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data.

The components we focus on:

1. Item 1A - Risk factors. These outline any and all risks the company faces or may face in the future. The risks are typically listed in order of importance.

2. Item 7 - Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Also known as MD&A, this gives the company an opportunity to explain its business results from the previous fiscal year. This section is where the company can tell its story in its own words.
